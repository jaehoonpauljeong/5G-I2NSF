# 5G-I2NSF
- This study presents an integrated framework for automated security orchestration in 5G edge networks based on the Interface to Network Security Functions (I2NSF) system.
- The proposed system translates a high-level security policy in YANG/XML into the corresponding low-level security policy in YANG/XML and dynamically deploys the corresponding Network Security Functions (NSFs) within the User Plane Function (UPF).
- It also supports seamless policy migration during UE handovers, minimizing latency and ensuring consistent security enforcement across distributed edge environments.

## 5G-I2NSF Development Environment
- OS: Ubuntu 22.04
- Free5GC VM: version 4.1.0
- UERANSIM VM (UE & RAN): version 3.2.6
- GitHub Repository: https://github.com/jaehoonpauljeong/5G-I2NSF

## Workflow of the 5G-I2NSF Testbed
1. A high-level security policy is generated by the I2NSF User Function (IUF) based on a user's intent.
2. The Security Control Function (SCF) translates this high-level policy into the corresponding low-level policy.
3. The low-level policy is then delivered to the relevant 5G Core functions AMF and SMF via NEF, and appropriate Network Security Functions (NSFs) are instantiated within a UPF according to this policy.
4. After the NSFs are deployed within a UPF, the UE connected to gNB1 moves to gNB2 by handover.
5. By predicting the next gNB to which the UE will move, the Security Policy for NSFs (e.g., Firewall & Web Filter) in UPF1 in gNB1 is proactively migrated to UPF2 in gNB2.
6. Following the policy migration, the AMF manages the UE’s handover procedure, while the SMF reestablishes the N4 session with UPF2.
7. The UE’s data network access logs are collected and sent to the Security Data Analytics Function (SDAF) as monitoring reports.
8. These reports are analyzed by SDAF to verify whether the security policy is enforced well by NSFs or not.

## Future Work
- We plan to leverage LLMs to interpret natural language intents and generate YAML-based policies automatically, while AI-driven analysis will enhance security through adaptive learning, anomaly detection, and policy optimization.
