# 5G-I2NSF
## Objective
- This study presents an integrated framework for automated security orchestration in 5G edge networks based on the Interface to Network Security Functions (I2NSF) system.
- The proposed system translates a high-level security policy in YANG/XML into the corresponding low-level security policy in YANG/XML and dynamically deploys the corresponding Network Security Functions (NSFs) within the User Plane Function (UPF).
- It also supports seamless policy migration during UE handovers, minimizing latency and ensuring consistent security enforcement across distributed edge environments.
